A homepage for The Odin Project assignment

I need to work on using Git more. However the homepage ended up looking pretty good. Only able to commit an hour a day to
studying and it took me about 3 hours to create this in total.

Pretty happy with how it turned out. Starting to get the hang of flexbox and it's properties.

Most challenging part was getting the cite and cta button in the right position. However it wasn't too bad.
